If the data do not meet the assumptions of normality required for parametric tests like the paired t-test, but you want to determine if there is a trend between two paired samples, you can use the Wilcoxon paired-sample T test. This is a non-parametric statistical test used to compare two related samples or repeated measures. It is appropriate for this dataset, because each row of DNA and RNA were extracted from the same sample. Here we really want to know if our Dual extraction method is biased toward optimizing yield for DNA or RNA, or if there is any trend at all. > Our null and alternate hypotheses are:\nH0: There is no trend between the paired samples.\nH1: There is a trend between the paired samples.\n\nwilcox.test(x=qubit_scores$qubit_dna_avg, y=qubit_scores$qubit_rna_avg, paired=TRUE, alternative = 'two.sided')\n\n\n    Wilcoxon signed rank exact test\n\ndata:  qubit_scores$qubit_dna_avg and qubit_scores$qubit_rna_avg\nV = 86, p-value = 0.498\nalternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0\n\n\nThe Wilcoxon signed-rank test, as a non-parametric test, determines whether there is a shift or trend in the paired observations but does not provide information about the direction or magnitude of the shift. It only tells you that there is a significant difference between the paired samples, but it does not indicate which sample has higher values or the direction of the shift.\nTo determine the direction of the shift, you would need to examine the data and calculate the median or mean of the paired differences. If the median or mean of the differences is positive, it suggests that the second sample tends to have higher values than the first sample. Conversely, if the median or mean is negative, it indicates that the first sample tends to have higher values than the second sample.\nTo get a better understanding of the direction and magnitude of the shift, you may consider plotting the paired differences or constructing a confidence interval around the median or mean difference. This can provide additional insights into the nature of the shift and help you interpret the results more accurately.\nWe originally had wondered if we extracted more DNA would we receive less RNA, and vice versa, as we began to notice in the lab after extracting we’d see large quantities of DNA from one sample, and then that sample would yield low RNA amounts. We wanted to see if there was any significance in this observation, and after doing the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, we see that we cannot reject our null hypothesis of there being no trend between our RNA and DNA sample, as our p-value is pretty large, and which suggests that the two do not have an exact trend to one another. It would have been an interesting find to see that DNA and RNA extraction amounts were related, as that could have consequences on future data collection with our coral samples, so it was important to us to look into the significance."

Bring working samples on dry-ice back to the lab bench.\nDon cryo-gloves over nitrile gloves and ⚠️carefully⚠️ dispense a small amount (no more than 1L) of liquid nitrogen (LN2) into the transfer thermos. Everyone working with LN2 should have taken the Liquid Nitrogen Online Safety Course found HERE\nGrind each sample with mortar & pestle on LN2 -\n\n⚠️carefully⚠️ pour a small amount of LN2 into a sterilized mortar\nUsing sterilized forceps, pluck out coral fragments from the cryo vial and place in the mortar until you have as much material as about the size of an M&M (roughly a 16mm diameter sphere). Material amount does not have to be precise.\nPestle the coral fragment until it is ground to a powder. Work quickly to ensure the sample remains frozen. Add more LN2 when it evaporates from the mortar. This step is challenging! LN2 evaporates very quickly and must be replenished multiple times.\n\n\nThe coral is also very hard and prone to ‘squirting out’ from under the pestle, so be extra careful while grinding!\n\n\nLyse: Bead-Bash Samples\n\nUse sterilized scoopula to transfer the sample powder to its correspondingly labelled bead bashing tube\nAim to transfer 500uL of volume to each tube\nAdd 500uL of DNA/RNA Shield to each 2mL (0.1 - 0.5mm) bead-bashing tube with powdered sample and vortex to ensure powder is submersed in DNA/RNA Shield\n\n\n\nSet bead-bashing tubes in Mortexer and vortex at high speed for 40 minutes\n\n\n\n\nProteinase-K Digestion\n\nAfter bead bashing tubes are ‘intensely bubbly’\nTo tamp down bubbles, centrifuge in the mini-centrifuge for 1-2 minutes\nAdd Proteinase K & Buffer\n\nAdd the appropriate volume of Pro K buffer and Proteinase K (Proteinase K is stored in the -20 after being reconstituted)\n(10:1 ratio of sample:digestion buffer) & (2:1 ratio of digestion buffer:Proteinase K)\nFor tubes with 500ul add:\n\n50ul pro k buffer\n25ul proteinase K\n\nIf you have tubes with a larger volume you can scale up the volumes (ex for 700ul, you would use 70ul buffer and 35ul pro k)\n\nLet incubate at room temperature for 2 hours\n\nOR.. alternate protocol according to Putnam Lab Members Kevin Wong Porites Extractions and M.E.

    "text": "May 30, 2023\nTo Whom It May Concern:\nNora Hessen has been accepted to study at Friday Harbor Labs (FHL) for the Summer quarter of 2023, where she will take ‘Marine Botany: Diversity and Ecology’, a course taught by Dr. Wilson Freshwater and Dr. Tom Mumford. FHL is renowned for its hands-on learning approach in addition to its focus on field and lab work. During the course, Nora will be embarking on her first field experience, living at the field station in an immersive experiential learning environment and conducting her own independent project on macroalgae of the Puget Sound. \nMy Masters student, Sarah Tanja, is mentoring Nora as part of the pilot program, Identity, Belonging and Inquiry in Science (IBIS), which was specifically developed to better engage students from diverse backgrounds in independent marine research projects and science networking opportunities. Sarah will continue to mentor Nora during the Marine Botany Course in her role as TA. During the class students develop a project based on what they learn and their personal interests. Sarah will mentor Nora as she plans and conducts an experiment on Puget Sound Nereocystis luetkeana (bull kelp) gametophytes. Nora’s research question is “How does temperature affect the male/female ratio of bull kelp gametophyte survival?” Sex-based variation in species responses to changing ocean conditions is understudied and critical for marine management and conservation. This project could provide insight into bull kelp population changes due to climate change. The project will be used as an undergraduate research experience for Nora. This research will be presented at the commencement of the course, published in the Friday Harbor Labs Student Research Papers Archive, and made into a poster for the Society for Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics & Native Americans in Science (SACNAS) conference to be held October 26-28, 2023 in Portland, Oregon. This work aligns with the high caliber research conducted in the Padilla-Gamiño Lab and our commitments to equity and inclusion. \nNora is an excellent candidate for undergrad experiential learning support; she is committed, responsible, and disciplined in her pursuit of knowledge and skills to further her education in her chosen field. She is extremely interested in pursuing field-work and is already looking beyond her time at FHL for additional pathways to hands-on experiences in marine biology. Over the course of the IBIS pilot program, Nora has shown eagerness to go hands-on, opportunities for which had been delayed or diminished in Nora’s early collegiate career due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n\nNora has expressed particular interest in kelp research and is excited to develop a better understanding of kelp and their importance within the Puget Sound. Her long-term goals include graduate school and deepening her expertise and honing her skills as a Marine Biologist and researcher. However, these exciting aspirations need support. As a first-time field scientist, Nora has yet to build up her ‘field-kit’ of foul weather gear that is vital both for successful field data collections and for a budding scientists’ safety, comfort, and sense of belonging. This award would provide Nora with the necessary funds to purchase boots for tide-pooling, a good-quality rain jacket for working outside in rainy Puget Sound, warm layers, gloves, hats, rite-in-the-rain notebooks, and the myriad other gear items that students are expected to have as per the student packing list. The award will also provide funds for WA State Ferry travel, the 3-hour drive to Anacortes from Seattle, and required course macroalgae identification guides. This award, delivered on June 1st, is timed perfectly for Nora to acquire gear prior to traveling to FHL on June 10th. This would allow Nora to jump right into field-work at Friday Harbor, focus on research, collect data, and take advantage of all the experiential learning Friday Harbor Labs has to offer. \nGearing up as a first-time field scientist can be costly. Coming from a family of 5, Nora has not had access to financial support regarding her education without the help of generous scholarship programs and Federal Pell Grants. While these scholarships and grants assist with tuition and fees, they do not cover personal items that are required for students at FHL. With the additional funds from this award, Nora will have the means to access gear necessary for her field-work. Nora has excelled within the University of Washington’s Marine Biology program while being a full time, job-working student who is also taking part in the IBIS program. She is passionate about her studies, and has continued to further her education and explore her major-related interests. Nora is very deserving of, and the perfect candidate for this award. This award would greatly reduce the burden of financial pressures on Nora’s educational journey, and allow her to wholeheartedly engage in researching macroalgae while at Friday Harbor. I strongly urge you to consider awarding Nora Hessen $1000 for her long-anticipated first step out into the field of Marine Biology. \nThank you for your consideration.\nSincerely, \n\n\n\nDr. Jacqueline Padilla-Gamiño\nAssociate Professor\nSchool of Aquatic & Fishery Sciences"

    "text": "Program on Climate Change Climate Solutions Grant Application\nParticipants\nIdentity, Belonging and Inquiry in Science (IBIS) mentorship program participants:\nSarah Tanja, UW SAFS, graduate student\nNora Hessen, UW Oceanography, undergraduate student\n\nRationale\nCoral reefs sustain 25% of the world’s marine biodiversity and are vital to economic and food security for hundreds of millions of people (Souter et al. 2020). They are endangered worldwide by climate change and pollution. Under a CMIP6 climate scenario, it is forecasted that more than 75% of coral reefs will experience yearly severe bleaching before 2070 due to thermal stress. Researchers are hustling for solutions to conserve coral reefs and their vital habitat functions; by exploring everything from coral planting restoration to genetic modification. We think that a key part to future coral conservation will be reducing coastal pollution from plastic waste (Claar et al. 2020). To test this, we conducted a multiple stressor experiment by exposing Montipora capitata corals to both heat stress and plasticizers commonly found in plastic consumer products. We hypothesize that the combined stressors will increase pathogenic bacteria associated with the coral holobiont and increase transcriptional changes linked to endocrine disrupting pathways compared with both the control and heat stress alone. We now have 280 samples from the experiment frozen at -80C and ready for genomics analysis. Through the IBIS mentoring program, we hope to simultaneously foster undergraduate research experience and open the molecular and bioinformatics tool-kit needed to address this piece of the coral reef conservation puzzle.\nUse of Funds\nWe propose to use the Climate Solutions Grant to pay for RNA extraction kits and sequencing services to be used for our collaborative graduate to undergraduate IBIS mentoring program research project. While it doesn’t cost money to work together in a lab, or learn to use free open-source bioinformatics software, it does cost to pay for sample RNA extraction kits and sequencing services. Paying for these necessary steps in the research process is the biggest barrier our IBIS project has currently.\n\nProposed Budget\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem\nQuant.\nPrice ea.\nCost\n\n\n\n\nDNA/RNA extraction kits, 10 preps\n2\n$86.90\n$173.80\n\n\nTotal RNA Sequencing Service, per sample\n20\n$200\n$4000\n\n\n\nTotal : \n\n$4173.80\n\n\n\nTimeline\nWe will begin conducting lab work at the start of the 2023 Spring quarter, and expect preliminary results by the end of Spring quarter.\n\nExpected Impact\nThis project is a stepping stone to involve minority undergrads with research, and build community, momentum, and engagement with climate solutions inquiries. This is a novel line of research that will add to coral reef conservation efforts and fill gaps in our understanding of the ecotoxicological effects of plastic pollution in the context of ocean warming. We expect to post regularly about this project in an open-science GitHub repository, publish this work as co-authors, and present this at an end of program IBIS celebration.\n\n\nReferences\nClaar, Danielle C., Samuel Starko, Kristina L.

This is a necessary quality check (QC) because we want to make sure the samples we send for sequencing actually have enough good RNA in them to sequence.\nThe Qubit allows us to measure RNA integrity & quality (IQ) extracted in our samples. For high-quality RNA, we’re looking for long and intact strands of RNA."

Only 1uL is needed from the sample to run Qubit. This tiny amount is prone to pipetting error, which can be influenced by temperature. Make sure the aliquot you are pulling 1uL from is well thawed.\n\n\nSet up 2 assay tubes for the standards and 1 tube for each sample\n\nlabel assay tube lids\n\nWarning Notice: Label only the cap of the assay tube, the sides need to remain clear for the fluorometer to penetrate through and read the sample {: .notice–warning}\n\nrip off sheet of foil to cover sample tube rack to protect from light\n\nWarning Notice: Qubit RNA BR dye-reagent (component A) is light sensitive, and must be kept in the dark (tube wrapped in foil) {: .notice–warning}\n\n\nStep 2. Prepare Working Solution\ntldr: For 8 samples and 2 standards, you will need 2mL of working solution, to prepare it in a 1:200 dilution of dye-reagent to buffer, pipette 10uL of Qubit dye-reagent plus 1,990uL of Qubit buffer into a 15mL falcon tube, cap & invert to mix. {: .notice–success}\n\ncalculate volume of working solution you need –> ( 2 x 190uL ) + (no. of samples x 199uL) (ex. 2 x 190uL + 8 x 199uL) = 1,972uL round up to 2ml\nstandard #1 - 190uL working solution, 10uL standard\nstandard #2 - 190uL working solution, 10uL standard\nsample 1 - 199uL working solution, 1uL sample\nsample 2 - 199uL working solution, 1uL sample\nsample 3 - 199uL working solution, 1uL sample\n.. etc.\n\nThe working solution is 1 part dye-reagent to 200 parts buffer\ncalculate a 1:200 dilution of dye-reagent to buffer\ndivide working solution volume (uL) by 200 to find volume (uL) of dye-reagent (ex. 2000uL / 200 = 10uL dye-reagent)\nsubtract volume (uL) of dye-reagent from working solution volume to get buffer volume. (ex. 2000uL - 10uL = 1990uL buffer)\n\ntake 15mL falcon tube, add above volumes of dye-reagent and buffer to make the final working solution volume. Cap & invert falcon tube to mix.Note: The final volume in each tube must be 200 µL. Each standard tube requires 190 µL of Qubit™ working solution, and each sample tube requires anywhere from 180–199 µL. Ensure that you have sufficient Qubit™ working solution to accommodate all standards and samples, with a little ‘extra’. {: .notice–info}\n\n\n\nStep 3.

Vortex standards and samples for 2–3 seconds and let sit at room temperature for 2 minutes\n\n\nStep 5. Read Samples\n\nSelect RNA Broad Range Assay on the Qubit® 2.0 Fluorometer to calibrate with standards\n\nWarning Notice: Qubit™ assays delivers optimal performance when all solutions are at room temperature; temperature fluctuations can influence the accuracy of the assay. To minimize temperature fluctuations, insert all assay tubes into the Qubit™ Fluorometer only for as much time as it takes for the instrument to measure the fluorescence; the Qubit™ Fluorometer can raise the temperature of the assay solution significantly, even over a period of a few minutes. Do not hold the assay tubes in your hand before reading because this warms the solution and results in a low reading. {: .notice–warning}\n\nAfter calibration, read the samples with the same RNA Broad Range Assay selection on the Qubit Fluorometer. Cross your fingers they are in desired range 🤞\nRecord RNA IQ values\n\n\n\n\nsample\nqubit-rna-iq\nqubit-run-date\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload RNA IQ values using USB thumb-drive"

    "text": "Within the IBIS program, I’ve learned a lot about the process of research. From the start, Sarah and I had brainstormed projects that we both wanted to figure the answers to, and many of these projects we’re great ideas, but we simply just didn’t have the time nor the capability of performing such experiments with the limited resources we had. We decided to continue Sarah’s current graduate work with me tagging along to help analyze the coral samples that she had previously exposed to different concentrations of plastic leachates, and look at the changes in gene expression within the coral and the symbiots.\nOverall, I learned a lot about DNA/RNA extractions, the usage of R for making graphs and doing statistical analysis, and simply just communicating science by using R to create this blog. I also learned that science and research isn’t always a linear path, and it’s important to keep asking questions that you can explore, no matter if your project doesn’t always go the way you want it to at first. I’m grateful for this experience, and I truly learned a lot from Sarah and am excited to begin my own research career and explore graduate schools to continue to do my own research as I approach my senior year."
