    "text": "Hello!\nMy name is Nora Hessen and I am a current 3rd year student within UW’s Marine Biology department. I have been working with graduate student Sarah Tanja within the Identity, Belonging and Inquiry in Science (IBIS) program. Within our collaboration, we designed an experiment that we conducted across Winter 2022 and Spring 2023 quarters that involved DNA and RNA extractions from corals that were previously exposed to different levels of plastic leachates, in hopes to notice differences in gene expression between our treatment groups. This experience has taught me valuable information about what graduate research looks like, and the necessary steps one must take to finalize plans for research.\nA huge thank you is due to the UW Royalty Research Fund and the College of the Environment for funding such an amazing program that has definitely given me amazing insights into the details of research and allowed me to get my barrings within my first actual experience with research.\nCheck out more of my future posts for more in-depth information about the research and protocols I’ve done with Sarah!"

    "text": "The aim of this protocol is to take coral fragments that have been snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and extract both DNA for downstream archaea & bacteria microbiome 16S Microbiome Sequencing and RNA for downstream coral-host tissue Tag-seq or RNA-seq analysis.\nThe benefits of doing DNA and RNA extraction together are that it saves time, money, & sample material. It also facilitates paired sample analysis, where each data point in one dataset is uniquely paired to a data point in the second dataset because we are making duplicate measurements on the same sample.\nThe challenge is lysing the sample enough to get the bacterial DNA (busting open all those layers of cell membranes!) and retaining host (coral) RNA integrity.\nThis protocol relies heavily on the Zymo Research Protocol PDF & URI Putnam Lab Emma Strand’s notebook post on ‘Zymo-Duet-RNA-DNA-Extraction-Protocol’, with a few alterations suggested by Zymo tech on March 28th 2023 regarding optimized lysis protocols.\n📞Zymo is very responsive to phone calls! Any questions on the kit you can call 888-882-9682 and reference catalog number D7003 to ask technical questions galore."

I setup the lab bench with each phase occupying a station on the bench, with materials used in each phase arranged accordingly.

Since it’s important to keep track of which samples were extracted using the same kit, the same reagents, the same day, etc. for batch effects, I use extraction IDs (extr1, extr2, extr3 , etc.) to label samples that were processed together.\nEach sample will need the following 7 tubes labelled:\n\n\n\nlabel-7-tubes-diagram\n\n\nYou can also label an additional qubit tube if you are moving straight from extraction to quantification.\n\nOnly thin-wall, clear 0.5 mL PCR tubes are appropriate for use in the Qubit® fluorometer. Acceptable tubes include Qubit® assay tubes (Invitrogen Cat. no. Q32856, 500 tubes) or Axygen PCR-05-C tubes(VWR, part number 10011-830).\n\nThe qubit tube should only be labelled on the top; the sides should be clear so that the qubit fluorescence can be read without impedance.\nThe intermediate tubes and qubit tubes should be labelled with the cryo_id & extraction_id , such as: 1Ea extr1.\nThe FINAL tubes should be labelled with cryo_id, DNA/RNA, extraction_id, date (ddMMMyy), & initials, such as:\n1Ea\nRNA\nextr1\n10APR23\nSST\n⚠️Important Notes! ⚠️\n\nUse ethanol-proof lab markers to label tubes (ethanol is added to the green spin away collection tube)\nLabel collection tubes, not filters!\nAlways wear lab gloves that have been sterilized before handling tubes!\nShake tubes out of their bags onto sterilized surface, don’t ‘reach in’ (this reduces potential contamination)\n\n\n\nPrepare Buffers\n\nIf using the 50-prep kit (D7003), add 96 ml 100% ethanol (104 ml 95% ethanol) to the 24 ml DNA/RNA Wash Buffer concentrate.​ If using the 10-prep kit, DNA/RNA Wash Buffer (D7003T) is supplied ready-to-use and does not require the addition of ethanol.\nReconstitute lyophilized DNase I with DNase/RNase-Free Water and mix by gentle inversion. Use immediately or store frozen aliquots.\n50-prep, add 275 µl water\n10-prep, add 55 µl water\n\nReconstitute lyophilized Proteinase K at 20 mg/ml with Proteinase K Storage Buffer and mix by vortexing.

Work quickly and carefully to sort through the vials and select the ones that you are working with. Nest the selected sample vials in the dry ice, and return the rest back to the -80 freezer. Bring working samples on dry-ice back to the lab bench.\nDon cryo-gloves over nitrile gloves and ⚠️carefully⚠️ dispense a small amount (no more than 1L) of liquid nitrogen (LN2) into the transfer thermos. Everyone working with LN2 should have taken the Liquid Nitrogen Online Safety Course found HERE\nGrind each sample with mortar & pestle on LN2 -\n\n⚠️carefully⚠️ pour a small amount of LN2 into a sterilized mortar\nUsing sterilized forceps, pluck out coral fragments from the cryo vial and place in the mortar until you have as much material as about the size of an M&M (roughly a 16mm diameter sphere). Material amount does not have to be precise.\nPestle the coral fragment until it is ground to a powder. Work quickly to ensure the sample remains frozen. Add more LN2 when it evaporates from the mortar. This step is challenging! LN2 evaporates very quickly and must be replenished multiple times.\n\n\n\n\n\npirates-jack-sparrow-in-davy-jones-locker-with-a-single-peanut\n\n\nThe coral is also very hard and prone to ‘squirting out’ from under the pestle, much like the gif of the peanut above! {.notice: }\n\n\nLyse: Bead-Bash Samples\n\nUse sterilized scoopula to transfer the sample powder to its correspondingly labelled bead bashing tube\nAim to transfer 500uL of volume to each tube\nAdd 500uL of DNA/RNA Shield to each 2mL (0.1 - 0.5mm) bead-bashing tube with powdered sample and vortex to ensure powder is submersed in DNA/RNA Shield\nSet bead-bashing tubes in Mortexer and vortex at high speed for 40 minutes\n\n\n\nProteinase-K Digestion\n\nAfter bead bashing tubes are ‘intensely bubbly’\nTo tamp down bubbles, centrifuge in the mini-centrifuge for 1-2 minutes\nAdd Proteinase K & Buffer\n\nAdd the appropriate volume of Pro K buffer and Proteinase K (Proteinase K is stored in the -20 after being reconstituted)\n(10:1 ratio of sample:digestion buffer) & (2:1 ratio of digestion buffer:Proteinase K)\nFor tubes with 500ul add:\n\n50ul pro k buffer\n25ul proteinase K\n\nIf you have tubes with a larger volume you can scale up the volumes (ex for 700ul, you would use 70ul buffer and 35ul pro k)\n\nLet incubate at room temperature for 2 hours\n\nOR.. alternate protocol according to Putnam Lab Members Kevin Wong Porites Extractions and M.E.
