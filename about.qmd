Welcome to my Undergraduate research/class blog! My name is Nora Hessen and I am a 3rd year Marine Biology student at UW's College of the Environment. This page will contain posts about current research and programs that I'm apart of, different protocols that I follow within my lab spaces, and also some class related projects and research.
